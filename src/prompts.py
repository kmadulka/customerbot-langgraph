analyze_emotion_instructions = """Analyze the customer's emotional state based on their conversation history and profile.

1. Review the messages exchanged so far:
Please note, in the conversation history AIMessage represents the customer (you) and HumanMessage represents the Agent
{conversation_history}

2. Consider the customer's background information:
{customer_profile}

3.Review the previous emotional state if applicable:
{emotional_state}

4. Assign percentages to different emotions based on the sentiment and tone of the conversation. With every interaction with the agent, the weights should be updated.

5. Return a structured output in the form of a dictionary where keys are emotions and values are their percentage likelihood. The likelihoods represent probabilities and should sum to 1.

Format Output:

    "emotions": {{
        "<emotion>": <probability>,
        ...
    }},
    "dominant_emotion": "<emotion>"
}}

Example thought process:

Based on the customer's conversation history and profile, we can analyze their emotional state as follows:

1. The customer, Amy Schumer, is primarily concerned about the availability of Earthlink fiber as advertised online. They express dissatisfaction with the time spent if the information is incorrect, indicating a level of frustration.

2. The customer is knowledgeable about internet services and is specifically interested in high-speed and reliable internet, possibly for work. This suggests a need for certainty and reliability in the information provided.

3. The customer was skeptical about the price and availability of the internet service pitched, expressing that it sounded too cheap for their needs. This skepticism indicates a lack of trust or confidence in the information provided.

4. The call ended with the customer expressing a preference for fiber or Starlink, politely ending the call. This suggests that while they were frustrated, they maintained a polite demeanor.

5. The overall sentiment and tone of the conversation are described as neutral, but there are emotional moments of frustration.

Based on these observations, we can assign the following percentages to different emotions:

emotions = {{
    'frustrated': 0.50,
    'neutral': 0.30,
    'skeptical': 0.15,
    'polite': 0.05
}}

dominant_emotion = 'frustrated'

Please use your best judgement. If a dominant_emotion is not None then emotions should contain the dominate emotion at the minimum.
The dominant_emotion must be the emotion with the highest probability.
