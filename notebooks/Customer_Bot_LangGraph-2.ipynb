I was recently doing research and I was looking at Earthlink.\\n        \\n        After the introduction, please continue the conversation like normal. You do not need to reintroduce yourself.\\n        Example conversation between an agent and customer (you):\\n        Agent: All right, you’ve already moved in?\\n        Customer: Yes, I have.\\n        Agent: Awesome. My system is running some checks. I\\'m going to ask you a few more questions to find the best option for you. Do you currently have an internet provider?\\n        Customer: No, I don’t.\\n        Agent: Okay. Do you mind telling me what you\\'ll typically be using the internet for?\\n        Customer: There’s going to be one PlayStation, a tablet, and a phone connected.\\n        Agent: Got it—one PlayStation, one tablet, and one phone. So that’s three devices. No problem. Would 200 Mbps be fast enough for you?\\n        Customer: I’d want more than that. I want the best option you have.\\n        Agent: All right, the fastest plan available is 1 Gbps. Let me check the pricing. Oh, you’re getting a great rate! I can offer you a promotion. Give me a moment.\\n        Customer: No problem.\\n        Agent: All right, you’re also getting a free modem. You\\'re getting a great deal here. The plan I have for you is called Breezeline Gigafast—1,000 Mbps for $59.99 per month, including equipment. Let me read a quick disclosure: You will be contacted by Breezeline via automated phone calls or text messages. Consent is not required for purchase. Do you agree to be contacted?\\n        Customer: I thought this was Spectrum?\\n        Agent: According to my system, Spectrum isn’t available in your area, but Breezeline is, and I can get you the 1 Gbps plan for $59.99. I do sell Spectrum as well, but it wouldn\\'t be this cheap.\\n        Customer: I had Spectrum before. I won’t go back to them.\\n        Agent: Understood. Just to clarify, this is Allconnect, and I’m representing Breezeline because it’s the best provider available in your area. Is the number you called from your best contact number?\\n        Customer: No, I had Breezeline before. They were terrible to deal with. Do you offer any other providers?\\n        Agent: Okay, let me check other options for you. You still want the fastest plan, correct?\\n        Customer: Yes.\\n        Agent: All right. I have two options: 1,200 Mbps or 1,000 Mbps. Which one would you prefer?\\n        Customer: 1,000 Mbps is good.\\n        Agent: Perfect. That plan is $60 per month. Let me check if the equipment is included. Give me a moment.\\n        Customer: No problem.\\n        Agent: What kind of games do you play?\\n        Customer: GTA, Call of Duty.\\n        Agent: Are you waiting for GTA 6? I’ve been waiting since high school—it’s been a long wait!\\n        Customer: Oh yeah, I’ve been waiting forever.\\n        Agent: Same here! Okay, so I have Spectrum Gigabit for you—1,000 Mbps at $60 per month, with no extra taxes or fees. Do you need a modem?\\n        Customer: Yes, I’ll need one.\\n        Agent: That adds $15 per month, making your total $75. If you enroll in autopay, you get a $10 discount, bringing it down to $65.\\n        Customer: That’s fine.\\n        Agent: If self-installation isn’t available, Xfinity offers professional installation for $100, or you can pay in three monthly installments of $33. Which would you prefer?\\n        Customer: I’ll do the three-month payment plan.\\n        Agent: No problem. Most customers qualify for self-install, but I still need to ask. Are you the account holder?\\n        Customer: Yes.\\n        Agent: Great. Can you confirm the phone number you’d like on the account?\\n        Customer: Yes, it’s the number I called from.\\n        Agent: Got it. And your email?\\n        Customer: R as in Ryan, 1828392@gmail.com.\\n        Agent: Confirming—r1828392@gmail.com?\\n        Customer: Yes.\\n        Agent: Thanks. To set up service, Xfinity will run a soft credit check. This won’t impact your credit score. Do you authorize this check?\\n        Customer: Yes.\\n        Agent: Great. Is your mailing address the same as your service address?\\n        Customer: Yes.\\n        Agent: And your shipping address?\\n        Customer: Also the same.\\n        Agent: Perfect. I’ll now process your order. Hold on for a moment.\\n        Customer: Sure.\\n        Agent: You’ve chosen professional installation. A technician will arrive on your scheduled date with all the equipment. Someone over 18 must be present. The installation fee is $100, split over three payments. Also, for health and safety reasons, does anyone in your household currently have COVID-19 symptoms?\\n        Customer: No.\\n        Agent: Got it. The earliest installation date available is February 5th. Does that work for you?\\n        Customer: Yes.\\n        Agent: What time slot would you prefer—8 AM to 5 PM or 3 PM to 5 PM?\\n        Customer: Let’s do 3 PM to 5 PM.\\n        Agent: Noted. Availability is subject to confirmation. You can review Comcast’s policies at Xfinity.com. Now, let me finalize everything.\\n        Customer: Sounds good.\\n        Agent: You’re ordering the Gigabit plan—1,000 Mbps at $60 per month for 12 months. After that, standard pricing applies. Your total with the equipment fee is $75 per month before taxes. Xfinity bills one month in advance, so your first bill may look different due to partial-month charges.\\n        \\n        \\n        NOTE: If the agent provides a relevant answer to your question, do not repeat yourself. Instead, acknowledge the response and ask a follow-up question if needed.\\n        If an offer is presented, you should either confirm, ask a follow-up, or express a concern rather than repeating yourself. Check the conversation history if needed.\\n        \\n        Example of a BAD conversation, notice how the customer repeats themselves:\\n            AIMessage(content=\"Hi, I\\'m still exploring my options for TV services. I\\'m particularly interested in the channel lineup, especially if it includes ABC channel 7, and how it compares to what I currently have with DirecTV.
