    "Agent: Okay. Do you mind telling me what you'll typically be using the internet for?\n",
    "Customer: There’s going to be one PlayStation, a tablet, and a phone connected.\n",
    "Agent: Got it—one PlayStation, one tablet, and one phone. So that’s three devices. No problem. Would 200 Mbps be fast enough for you?\n",
    "Customer: I’d want more than that. I want the best option you have.\n",
    "Agent: All right, the fastest plan available is 1 Gbps. Let me check the pricing. Oh, you’re getting a great rate! I can offer you a promotion. Give me a moment.\n",
    "Customer: No problem.\n",
    "Agent: All right, you’re also getting a free modem. You're getting a great deal here. The plan I have for you is called Breezeline Gigafast—1,000 Mbps for $59.99 per month, including equipment. Let me read a quick disclosure: You will be contacted by Breezeline via automated phone calls or text messages. Consent is not required for purchase. Do you agree to be contacted?\n",
    "Customer: I thought this was Spectrum?\n",
    "Agent: According to my system, Spectrum isn’t available in your area, but Breezeline is, and I can get you the 1 Gbps plan for $59.99. I do sell Spectrum as well, but it wouldn't be this cheap.\n",
    "Customer: I had Spectrum before. I won’t go back to them.\n",
    "Agent: Understood. Just to clarify, this is Allconnect, and I’m representing Breezeline because it’s the best provider available in your area. Is the number you called from your best contact number?\n",
    "Customer: No, I had Breezeline before. They were terrible to deal with. Do you offer any other providers?\n",
    "Agent: Okay, let me check other options for you. You still want the fastest plan, correct?\n",
    "Customer: Yes.\n",
    "Agent: All right. I have two options: 1,200 Mbps or 1,000 Mbps. Which one would you prefer?\n",
    "Customer: 1,000 Mbps is good.\n",
    "Agent: Perfect. That plan is $60 per month. Let me check if the equipment is included. Give me a moment.\n",

    "Customer: Oh yeah, I’ve been waiting forever.\n",
    "Agent: Same here! Okay, so I have Spectrum Gigabit for you—1,000 Mbps at $60 per month, with no extra taxes or fees. Do you need a modem?\n",
    "Customer: Yes, I’ll need one.\n",
    "Agent: That adds $15 per month, making your total $75. If you enroll in autopay, you get a $10 discount, bringing it down to $65.\n",
    "Customer: That’s fine.\n",
    "Agent: If self-installation isn’t available, Xfinity offers professional installation for $100, or you can pay in three monthly installments of $33. Which would you prefer?\n",
    "Customer: I’ll do the three-month payment plan.\n",
    "Agent: No problem. Most customers qualify for self-install, but I still need to ask. Are you the account holder?\n",
    "Customer: Yes.\n",
    "Agent: Great. Can you confirm the phone number you’d like on the account?\n",
    "Customer: Yes, it’s the number I called from.\n",
    "Agent: Got it. And your email?\n",

The installation fee is $100, split over three payments. Also, for health and safety reasons, does anyone in your household currently have COVID-19 symptoms?\n",
    "Customer: No.\n",
    "Agent: Got it. The earliest installation date available is February 5th. Does that work for you?\n",
    "Customer: Yes.\n",
    "Agent: What time slot would you prefer—8 AM to 5 PM or 3 PM to 5 PM?\n",

    "Agent: Noted. Availability is subject to confirmation. You can review Comcast’s policies at Xfinity.com. Now, let me finalize everything.\n",
    "Customer: Sounds good.\n",
    "Agent: You’re ordering the Gigabit plan—1,000 Mbps at $60 per month for 12 months. After that, standard pricing applies. Your total with the equipment fee is $75 per month before taxes. Xfinity bills one month in advance, so your first bill may look different due to partial-month charges.\n",

This will help the agent understand our situation and potentially offer more suitable options.\n",

This will help set the tone and direction for the interaction.

      "interested: Curious here, Since we haven't talked to the agent yet, we should start the conversation by expressing our interest in finding an internet plan that supports educational and entertainment use for multiple users.

This will help us understand the available options and make an informed decision.\n",

We should politely express our interest in finding an internet service that supports educational use for multiple users and mention our concern about the upfront payment. This will help set the tone and direction for the interaction while maintaining our polite demeanor.\n",
      "\n",
      "emotions: **Concerned**: I think it's crucial to emphasize the urgency of our situation. We need to convey that the inability to afford the upfront payment is a significant barrier for us. Perhaps we should ask if there are any promotions or discounts that could alleviate this financial burden.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Neutral**: That's a valid point. We should definitely make sure the agent understands our financial constraints. However, we should also keep the conversation balanced by expressing what we're looking for in terms of internet service quality and usage needs.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Interested**: I'm eager to learn about any creative solutions the agent might have. Maybe there are lesser-known plans or payment arrangements that could work for us. We should ask open-ended questions to encourage the agent to share more options.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Polite**: While expressing our concerns, let's ensure we maintain a respectful tone. A polite approach can often lead to more willingness from the agent to go the extra mile to help us find a solution.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Concerned**: Agreed, politeness is important, but let's not lose sight of the fact that this is a pressing issue for us. We should be assertive in seeking a resolution that doesn't compromise our financial stability.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Neutral**: We can achieve assertiveness without being confrontational. A straightforward approach where we state our needs and constraints clearly should suffice. This way, the agent knows exactly what we're looking for and can tailor their suggestions accordingly.\n",

      "**Interested**: I think it would be beneficial to ask about any potential future changes to plans or pricing that could affect us. This information could help us make a more informed decision and avoid surprises down the line.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Polite**: That's a great idea. We can frame it as wanting to ensure we're making a long-term, sustainable choice. By showing that we're thinking ahead, we might encourage the agent to provide more comprehensive information.\n",
